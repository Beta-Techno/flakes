* Longer‑term (2026+) ideas
  | Idea | Status | Notes |
  |------|--------|-------|
  | Monorepo experiment (Bazel) | *research* | Prototype in `experiments/` branch; measure CI time. |
  | BSL‑licensed AI agent for routine PRs | *backlog* | Needs legal review (BSL → Apache after 36 mo). |
  | IPv6‑only cluster support | *backlog* | Requires module updates + service manifests. |

* Proposal workflow

1. Fork / branch this file → add heading =*** P‑XX Title= with rationale & rough sizing.
2. Open PR tagged =proposal=; gather feedback in comments.
3. Quarterly roadmap review merges accepted items; rejected items are closed with explanation.
